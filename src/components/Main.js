            <p className='text-left'> Coming from Tainan, after my graduation from Tainan Girls High School, I studied Computer Science and Information Engineering in National Taipei University. With my experience  in CSIE and the training from my current occupation, I am capable of understanding topics such as data analysis, artificial intelligence and topics likewise. I also have experience in Japanese culture and a broader understanding of Japanâ€™s daily lives and customs. The 1 year time I spent in Japan might not be much but it is still proof of my capability when it comes to Japanese.  Most importantly, I understand the value of self learning and self improvement, and I am thrilled that I can have the chance to grow with a promising company.
                Thank you for reviewing my CV, and it is my sincere hope that I will be hearing from you soon.
